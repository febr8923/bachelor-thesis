    raise Exception(_ERROR_INPUT_CPU_QUERY_WITH_FLASH_ATTN_ACTIVATED)
Exception: We detect you have activated flash attention support, but running model computation on CPU. Please make sure that your input data has been placed on GPU. If you actually want to run CPU computation, please following the readme and set device_map="cpu" to disable flash attention when loading the model (calling AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained).
检测到您的模型已激活了flash attention支持，但正在执行CPU运算任务。如使用flash attention，请您确认模型输入已经传到GPU上。如果您确认要执行CPU运算，请您在载入模型（调用AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained）时，按照readme说法，指定device_map="cpu"以禁用flash attention。
