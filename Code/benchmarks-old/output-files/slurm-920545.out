Both `max_new_tokens` (=512) and `max_length`(=20) seem to have been set. `max_new_tokens` will take precedence. Please refer to the documentation for more information. (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/text_generation)

This code creates a `stdClass` object with the specified properties and assigns it to the `$object` variable. The `print_r()` function is used to output the object properties.
When you run this code, you should see the following output:
```
stdClass Object
(
    [name] => John
    [age] => 30
    [hobby] => Golf
)
```
Note that the object properties are accessed using the object property syntax (`$object->name`, `$object->age`, etc.)
