prompts:
intel dataset (pytorch version)#
multiple different sizes -> mulitipe lines for 4 different sizes, four lines in one graphic

- add batch size

model in 3d:
memory requirement
performance
cost
 - sm utilization
 - how much memory
 - load time

plot on this 3d space

2 cases:
- different work loads and different comain
- 2-3 analyze input  -> how does changing them 

assumption
 - sm b*memory
 - how much memory is it using 

1) for all application meansure
    measure time for data movement
    how much memory using (nvidia-smi; query interface); measure data points at every time. 
    compute utilization (cpu: mpstat 1 (columns of cpu is used); gpu: )
    performance
    nr. of sms

2) 

3) vary batch-size
